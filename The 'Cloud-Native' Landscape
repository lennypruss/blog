<p>Over the last
several years, we&rsquo;ve seen the emergence new application architecture &ndash; dubbed
&ldquo;cloud native&rdquo; &ndash; that is highly distributed, elastic and composable with the
container as the modular compute abstraction. With that, a new breed of tools
has emerged to help deploy, manage and scale these applications. Cluster
management, service discovery, scheduling, etc. &ndash; terms that previously were
unfamiliar or, at best, reserved for the realm of high-performance computing &ndash; are
now becoming part of every IT organization&rsquo;s lexicon. As the pace of innovation
continues at breakneck speed, a taxonomy to help understand the elements of
this new stack is helpful.</p><p>The &ldquo;Cloud-Native&rdquo;
Ecosystem presentation is the consequence of many conversations with
developers, CIOs and founders who are playing a critical role in shaping this
new application paradigm. It attempts to define the discreet components of the
cloud-native stack and calls out the vendors, products and projects that
comprise the ecosystem.</p><p>

Note, this is an
ever-evolving document that&rsquo;s meant to be collaborative and is by no means a
hardened or exhaustive industry landscape. If you have suggestions, edits
and/or know of products or companies that should be included please don&rsquo;t
